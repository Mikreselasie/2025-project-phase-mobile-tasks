# üõçÔ∏è Task 10: Flutter E-commerce Project with Clean architecture

## üöÄ Overview

This Flutter project demonstrates a simple e-commerce application with clean architecture that follows the onion model in which the innner layers are independent of the outer layer.

## Tests included

- **Product Model Test**
  - **File Location**: test/features/product/data/models/product_model_test.dart

  - **Check if Product model is subclass of Product**
  - **Check if fromJSON method is working well**
  - **Check if toJSON method is workin well**

- **Create Product Test**: This test verifies that the CreateProduct use case correctly interacts with the ProductRepository to create a product.
  - **File Location**: test/features/product/domain/usecases/create_product_test.dart

  - Ensures the **createProduct** method in the repository is called with the correct Product entity.
  - Confirms that the result returned by the use case matches the expected Right(Product) value.
  - Uses mockito to isolate and mock the repository behavior.

- **Delete Product Use Case**

  - The repository's deleteProduct method is called with the correct productId. 
  - The result is a successful Right(unit) response.
  - No unexpected repository interactions occur.
  - **Uses**:
    - mockito for mocking the repository
    - dartz for Right and unit

- **Get All Products Use Case**
  - Tests that the GetAllProducts use case fetches the product list from the repository.
  - **Verifies**:
    - Calls getAllProducts() on the repository
    - Returns a Right(List<Product>) result
    - No other interactions with the repository
  - **Tools Used**:
    - mockito to mock the repository
    - dartz for Right and NoParams

- **Get Product By ID Use Case**
  - This test ensures the GetProduct use case correctly retrieves a product from the repository using its ID.
  - **Verifies**:
    - Calls getProductById() with the correct ID
    - Returns a Right(Product) result
    - No additional interactions with the repository
  - **Tools Used**:
    - mockito to mock the repository
    - dartz for Right and NoParams
- **Update Product Use Case**
  - This test ensures that the UpdateProduct use case properly updates a product through the repository.
  - **Verifies**:
    - Calls updateProduct() with the correct Product entity
    - Returns Right(Product) upon success
    - Confirms no unexpected repository interactions
  - **Tools Used**:
    - mockito to mock the repository
    - dartz for Right and NoParams

For best practices, each navigation action should use `Navigator.push`, `Navigator.pop`, or `Navigator.pushNamed` depending on your routing setup.
